# Performance Analysis Report

## Overview
This report contains performance analysis results from the CI/CD pipeline.

## Test Results
### Benchmark Tests
- CPU profiling data available in `cpu.prof`
- Memory profiling data available in `mem.prof`
- Detailed text reports generated for analysis

### Service Profiling
## Performance Recommendations

### CPU Optimization
1. Review CPU profile for hot spots in `cpu_profile.txt`
2. Look for functions consuming >10% CPU time
3. Consider optimizing algorithms in high-usage functions

### Memory Optimization
1. Check memory profile for allocation patterns in `mem_profile.txt`
2. Look for memory leaks or excessive allocations
3. Consider object pooling for frequently allocated objects

### Concurrency Analysis
1. Review goroutine profiles for potential deadlocks
2. Check for goroutine leaks
3. Optimize channel usage and synchronization

## Action Items
- [ ] Review profiles for performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement optimizations for identified issues
- [ ] Set up continuous performance monitoring
- [ ] Establish performance regression alerts

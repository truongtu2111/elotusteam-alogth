DATA FLOW PROCESSES
===================

1. UPLOAD FLOW
--------------
Step 1: Client uploads file via HTTPS
Step 2: API Gateway validates JWT token
Step 3: File validation (type, size, virus scan)
Step 4: Permission check (RBAC)
Step 5: Store original file in S3
Step 6: Queue image processing job
Step 7: Update database metadata
Step 8: Generate variants asynchronously
Step 9: Send notification to user

Data Path:
Client → API Gateway → Authentication → File Upload → Permission → Storage → Database → Notification

2. DOWNLOAD FLOW
----------------
Step 1: Client requests file via CDN URL
Step 2: CDN checks cache (edge locations)
Step 3: If cache miss, validate permissions
Step 4: Check Redis cache for metadata
Step 5: Select optimal image variant
Step 6: Retrieve from S3 storage
Step 7: Cache at CDN edge
Step 8: Serve to client with headers
Step 9: Log access for analytics

Data Path:
Client → CDN → Permission Check → Cache → Storage → CDN → Client

3. CACHE OPERATIONS
-------------------
• Permission Service ↔ Redis Cache
• Metadata Service ↔ Redis Cache
• Frequent data caching for performance optimization

4. DATABASE OPERATIONS
----------------------
• Primary Database → Read Replicas (synchronous replication)
• Write operations to primary
• Read operations distributed across replicas

5. ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING
--------------------------
• Message Queue → Background Workers
• Workers → Image Variants Storage
• Search Engine indexing from Metadata Service
